Car-Price-Predictions



Project Overview

This project predicts the selling price of used cars using machine learning regression models.   It uses  Linear Regression  and  Lasso Regression to learn from historical car sales data and predict prices for new inputs.


Dataset

The dataset includes car details such as:
- Car name
- Year of manufacture
- Present price
- Kms driven
- Fuel type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
- Seller type (Dealer/Individual)
- Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)
- Selling price (target variable)

Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Splitting into train/test sets

2. Model Training
   - Linear Regression
   - Lasso Regression

3. Model Evaluation
   - RÂ² Score
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Visualization of Actual vs Predicted prices

Results
- Both Linear Regression and Lasso Regression give reliable predictions.
- Scatter plots show a strong correlation between actual and predicted values.
